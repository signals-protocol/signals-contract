## Security Model

The RangeBet protocol follows these core security principles:

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each contract and function has only the minimum permissions necessary to perform its task.
2. **Principle of Isolation**: Each market operates independently, preventing vulnerabilities in one market from affecting others.
3. **Validation First**: All external inputs are validated before contract logic is executed.
4. **Transparency**: All logic and state changes are transparent and verifiable on-chain.

### Trust Assumptions

The RangeBet protocol makes the following trust assumptions:

1. **Owner Trust**: The contract owner has market creation and closure authority and is assumed not to use these privileges maliciously.
2. **Code Integrity**: The smart contract code and mathematical model are assumed to be free of defects.
3. **External Dependencies**: The PRBMath library and OpenZeppelin libraries are assumed to be secure.

## Potential Risks

The major risk factors identified in the RangeBet protocol are:

### 1. Economic Risks

- **Mathematical Model Errors**: Potential inaccurate pricing due to errors in the betting cost calculation formula
- **Price Manipulation**: Possibility of market price manipulation through large bets
- **Liquidity Imbalance**: Imbalances caused by excessive betting on specific bins

### 2. Smart Contract Risks

- **Reentrancy Attacks**: Possibility of reentrancy through external calls
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Potential overflow/underflow when processing large numbers
- **Gas Optimization Issues**: High gas costs due to complex mathematical operations

### 3. Governance Risks

- **Centralization Risk**: Excessive concentration of authority with the contract owner
- **Parameter Setting Errors**: Risks due to improper market parameter settings

## Mitigation Strategies

RangeBet implements the following security strategies to mitigate risks:

### 1. Economic Risk Mitigation

- **Mathematical Model Verification**: Independent verification and simulation of the betting cost calculation formula
- **Slippage Protection**: Limiting price impact through the `maxCollateral` parameter
- **Minimum/Maximum Betting Limits**: Preventing excessive market manipulation

### 2. Smart Contract Risks

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Protecting key functions using the `nonReentrant` modifier
- **Using SafeMath**: Using OpenZeppelin's SafeMath or Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow protection
- **Minimizing Dependencies**: Minimizing interactions with external contracts

### 3. Governance Risks

- **Separation of Roles**: Using multi-signature wallets for administrative functions
- **Transparent Parameter Setting**: Emitting events for all important parameter changes
- **Gradual Upgrades**: Phased upgrades and validation of changes

## Code Audits

The RangeBet protocol undergoes the following audit steps:

1. **Internal Review**: Code review among developers
2. **Formal Verification**: Mathematical model verification using formal verification tools
3. **Automated Tools**: Using automated security tools such as Slither, Mythril, etc.
4. **External Audit**: Review by independent security audit companies

## Security Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in the RangeBet protocol, please report it responsibly following these procedures:

1. **Private Reporting**: Do not post vulnerabilities on public forums or GitHub issues.
2. **Email Reporting**: Send vulnerability details to security@example.com.
3. **Encrypted Communication**: If necessary, you can encrypt communications using a PGP key.

### Report Content

When reporting security vulnerabilities, please include the following information:

1. Type and description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
3. Potential impact
4. Mitigation or fix suggestions, if possible

## Bug Bounty Program

RangeBet operates a bug bounty program to encourage identification of security vulnerabilities.

### Scope

- Smart contract code
- Mathematical model
- Protocol logic

### Severity Levels

1. **Critical**: Serious threat to fund loss or system integrity (10,000 USD)
2. **High**: Significant fund risk or critical function impairment (5,000 USD)
3. **Medium**: Limited fund risk or function impairment (2,000 USD)
4. **Low**: Minor issues or best practice suggestions (500 USD)

### Payment Method

- Payment in ETH or stablecoins after bug confirmation and severity assessment
- Payment completed before bug disclosure

## Emergency Plan

### Emergency Contacts

For urgent security issues:

- **Email**: emergency@example.com
- **Telegram**: @rangebet_security
- **Phone**: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (available 24/7)

### Emergency Response Process

1. **Alert Phase**: Security team receives alert and assesses severity
2. **Mitigation Phase**: Contract pause or emergency fix if necessary
3. **Resolution Phase**: Vulnerability fix and verification
4. **Communication Phase**: Providing situation updates to the community
5. **Post-Analysis Phase**: Analyzing incident causes and security improvements

### Contract Pausing

In case of serious vulnerabilities, the following functions can be used to pause part or all of the system:

```solidity
// Emergency pause function in RangeBetManager
function emergencyPause() external onlyOwner {
    // Implementation
}

// Unpause function
function unpause() external onlyOwner {
    // Implementation
}
```
